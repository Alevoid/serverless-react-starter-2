# serverless-react-starter2

Starter for using Serverless [ with GraphQL ] and React.

## Install and Run:

This is a monorepo: to quickly install dependencies in all packages and run fe and sls, just type from the root folder:

```
yarn quickInstall && yarn start
```

This is enough to have the project up and running;

fe: `http://localhost:3000`
sls be: `http://localhost:8080`

Otherwise packages can be installed and run separately.
